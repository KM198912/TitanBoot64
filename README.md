# TitanBoot64 🚀

**TitanBoot64** is a small 64-bit hobby kernel stub with Limine-like boot mappings and Multiboot2 support. It demonstrates a higher-half kernel layout, a Higher-Half Direct Map (HHDM) for physical ↔ virtual addressing, basic framebuffer and serial I/O, and parsing of Multiboot2 tags (including the memory map).

---

## Highlights ✅

- 64-bit kernel (x86_64) — kernel executes in the **higher half** at `0xffffffff80000000`.
- Limine-like memory mappings implemented in the boot stub:
  - Identity mapping for physical memory 0..4 GiB (2 MiB huge pages)
  - HHDM mapping: `virt = HHDM_BASE + physical` for phys 0..4 GiB (2 MiB pages)
  - Kernel mapping window at `KERNEL_VIRT_BASE` → small kernel window (configurable)
- Multiboot2 header and tag handling (framebuffer, memory map, etc.).
- Basic drivers & users:
  - Framebuffer early init + flanterm backend (text rendering)
  - Serial (COM1) I/O for early debug
  - Console printing using `printf`-style library
  - ACPI RSDP discovery via Multiboot2 (exposed through a Limine-like boot structure)
- Small test harness: draws/fills the framebuffer and prints the Multiboot memory map on boot.

## Current memory layout (boot stub behavior)

- Physical -> Virtual mappings are created as follows (2 MiB pages):

| Base Physical Address | Base Virtual Address | Notes |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ----- |
| 0x0000000000000000   | 0x0000000000000000  | Identity mapping (0..4 GiB, PD entries) |
| 0x0000000000000000   | HHDM start (e.g. `0xffff800000000000`) | HHDM mapping for phys < 4 GiB |
| Kernel physical load (e.g. 0x00200000) | Kernel VMA `0xffffffff80000000` + offset | Higher-half kernel mapping (PML4[511]) |

> NOTE: The project uses 2 MiB page mappings for identity and HHDM mappings so framebuffer and other low-physical MMIO regions are accessible both by physical identity and via the HHDM.

## Build & run 🛠️

Requirements:
- x86_64 cross toolchain (x86_64-elf-gcc / ld)
- `nasm`, `grub-mkrescue`, `xorriso`, `qemu-system-x86_64`

Build and run:

```bash
make           # build and create MyOS.iso
make run       # run in QEMU (uses -serial stdio)
```

## Third-party tools / libraries 📦

The following third-party components are vendored directly into the repository.
They are intentionally not included as git submodules to ensure build
reproducibility and offline availability.

- flanterm — framebuffer text backend (vendored)

- printf — freestanding printf-style formatting library (vendored)

## Design philosophy

TitanBoot64 does not replace Limine.  
Instead, it mirrors Limine’s *kernel-facing semantics* while remaining compatible
with GRUB and Multiboot2, lowering the barrier for testing kernels on real hardware.

---

## Status & TODO ✍️

- Implemented: Multiboot2 parsing (framebuffer, memory map), HHDM + identity map for 0..4 GiB, framebuffer write/debug, printing memory map.
- TODO:
  - Implement a physical memory allocator using the memory map
  - Finalize HHDM generic helpers and remove debug markers
  - Add more drivers (keyboard, PCI, ACPI parsing)

---

## Non-goals

- This is not a full bootloader
- This is not a production-ready kernel
- KASLR and relocation are intentionally out of scope (for now, contributions are always welcome!)

## Author Notes

- This project is **not a general-purpose toolkit or framework**.  
  It exists to demonstrate and provide Limine-like kernel semantics while remaining compatible with GRUB and Multiboot2.

- The primary motivation is to make it easier for hobby OS developers to test kernels on real hardware using an existing GRUB setup, without repeatedly writing bootable USB images.

- TitanBoot64 is intended as a **reference implementation and starting point**, not as a drop-in dependency.

- Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests for improvements, bug fixes, or new features.

- Happy coding!

## Acknowledgements

- Thanks to the developers of Limine and GRUB for their pioneering work in bootloading and kernel loading.
- Thanks to [Astrido](https://github.com/asterd-og) for the early framebuffer code.
- Thanks to the OSDev Wiki for its extensive documentation on Multiboot2 and x86_64 booting.

## Last Notes

- TitanBoot64 DOES NOT intend to replace Limine, or any other bootloader.
- It builds upon a working and battle-tested bootloader (GRUB) to provide a familiar environment for hobby OS developers.
- It aims to simplify kernel testing and development without the need for complex bootloader setups.
- Titanboot64 aswell enables SSE early, demonstrating floating-point operations in the kernel.
- While the OSDev wiki says, we aint ready for this, i personally think , by the time you consider this project, you are ready enough to handle the pitfalls of using SSE in kernel mode, and you know enough about osdev to understand the ASM code and what it does behind the scenes, if not, you are free to remove the SSE code in entry.c and read up on it more, its purely optional, however, if you do disable SSE, set the CFLAGS to -mno-sse and -mno-sse2 to avoid any accidental usage of SSE instructions, and aswell add the -DPRINTF_DISABLE_SUPPORT_FLOAT to the CFLAGS to avoid printf trying to use floating point support.
- And Lastly, it is a fun project to learn about low-level OS development! Enjoy! 🚀
