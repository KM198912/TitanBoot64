# TitanBoot64 🚀

**TitanBoot64** is a small 64-bit hobby kernel stub with Limine-like boot mappings and Multiboot2 support. It demonstrates a higher-half kernel layout, a Higher-Half Direct Map (HHDM) for physical ↔ virtual addressing, basic framebuffer and serial I/O, and parsing of Multiboot2 tags (including the memory map).

---

## Highlights ✅

- 64-bit kernel (x86_64) — kernel executes in the **higher half** at `0xffffffff80000000`.
- Limine-like memory mappings implemented in the boot stub:
  - Identity mapping for physical memory 0..4 GiB (2 MiB huge pages)
  - HHDM mapping: `virt = HHDM_BASE + physical` for phys 0..4 GiB (2 MiB pages)
  - Kernel mapping window at `KERNEL_VIRT_BASE` → small kernel window (configurable)
- Multiboot2 header and tag handling (framebuffer, memory map, etc.).
- Basic drivers & users:
  - Framebuffer early init + flanterm backend (text rendering)
  - Serial (COM1) I/O for early debug
  - Console printing using `printf`-style library
- Small test harness: draws/fills the framebuffer and prints the Multiboot memory map on boot.

## Current memory layout (boot stub behavior)

- Physical -> Virtual mappings are created as follows (2 MiB pages):

| Base Physical Address | Base Virtual Address | Notes |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ----- |
| 0x0000000000000000   | 0x0000000000000000  | Identity mapping (0..4 GiB, PD entries) |
| 0x0000000000000000   | HHDM start (e.g. `0xffff800000000000`) | HHDM mapping for phys < 4 GiB |
| Kernel physical load (e.g. 0x00200000) | Kernel VMA `0xffffffff80000000` + offset | Higher-half kernel mapping (PML4[511]) |

> NOTE: The project uses 2 MiB page mappings for identity and HHDM mappings so framebuffer and other low-physical MMIO regions are accessible both by physical identity and via the HHDM.

## Build & run 🛠️

Requirements:
- x86_64 cross toolchain (x86_64-elf-gcc / ld)
- `nasm`, `grub-mkrescue`, `xorriso`, `qemu-system-x86_64`

Build and run:

```bash
make           # build and create MyOS.iso
make run       # run in QEMU (uses -serial stdio)
```

## Third-party tools / libraries 📦

The following third-party components are vendored directly into the repository.
They are intentionally not included as git submodules to ensure build
reproducibility and offline availability.

- flanterm — framebuffer text backend (vendored)

## Status & TODO ✍️

- Implemented: Multiboot2 parsing (framebuffer, memory map), HHDM + identity map for 0..4 GiB, framebuffer write/debug, printing memory map.
- TODO:
  - Implement a physical memory allocator using the memory map
  - Finalize HHDM generic helpers and remove debug markers
  - Add more drivers (keyboard, PCI, ACPI parsing)
